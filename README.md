Metanoia
========

Metanoia is in very early stage of development. It is meant to be tiling surface
compositor for Wayland.

Metanoia tries to merge concepts from most popular tiling window managers like
i3, awesome, ratpoison or dwm, but there is still many things to work on. If you
are looking for working compositor it is much to early to choose metanoia, but
if you have programming skills and want to join development team, your help will
be appreciated.
