Configuration
=============

There will be three levels of configuration:

 * build time configuration - where user can chose program configuration which
   will be compiled into the program without need for additional config files.
   (Ultimately similar to dwm's configuration.)

 * plain text config file - **not yet implemented** - basically the same options
   as in build time configuration but read from text file in run time.

 * plugable modules written in scripting language (Python? Lua?) - **not yet
   implemented**. (Ultimately similar to Awesome's configuration.)

Build-time
----------

Currently there is only a few simple options that can be set in
`src/configuration.h` file. In future it is planned to add compositor
strategies.

Plain text

**Not yet implemented**.

Scripting language
