---------

MPL-2.0 was chosen as a license for source files because it is

 * popular and widely used or with strong community
   (according to [OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/category))

 * approved by FSF and OSI and compatible with GPL

 * file-level - does not impose itself on all files in repository

 * more business-friendly than GPL yet still copyleft
